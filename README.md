## Objective:
- Create an API for basketball-reference.com's per-season player stats.
### Problem:
- basketball-reference (bbref) is a go-to source for basketball statistics. **However**, bbref simply provides the data to view through its website without common developer resources, meaning that viewing, gathering, aggregating data provided can be difficult.
## Tech:
- Python 3
- MongoDB
- GraphQL
